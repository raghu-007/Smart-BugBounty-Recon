# Smart-BugBounty-Recon üïµÔ∏èüß†

An intelligent reconnaissance framework for bug bounty hunters, leveraging AI and advanced heuristics to identify and prioritize targets effectively.

## üöÄ Why "Smart"?

Traditional recon tools generate vast amounts of data. Smart-BugBounty-Recon aims to:
*   **Prioritize:** Help hunters focus on the most promising assets.
*   **Contextualize:** Provide deeper insights beyond simple enumeration.
*   **Automate Intelligently:** Go beyond basic scripting with smarter decision-making.
*   **Uncover Hidden Gems:** Identify attack surface that might be missed by standard tools.

## ‚ú® Key Features (Planned & In-Progress)

*   **Comprehensive Asset Discovery:**
    *   Advanced Subdomain Enumeration (integrating multiple sources & techniques)
    *   IP & Port Analysis
    *   Cloud Asset Identification
*   **Deep Technology Profiling:**
    *   Accurate tech stack detection
    *   Version identification and known vulnerability cross-referencing (e.g., via CVE databases)
*   **Content & Endpoint Analysis:**
    *   Intelligent directory/file brute-forcing
    *   JavaScript file analysis for sensitive information and endpoints (potentially using NLP/RegEx)
    *   API endpoint discovery
*   **üß† AI-Powered Prioritization Engine:**
    *   Scoring assets based on technology risk, exposed services, potential misconfigurations.
    *   (Future) NLP on website content or `robots.txt` for interesting keywords.
    *   (Future) Anomaly detection in discovered assets.
*   **Modular Design:** Easily extensible with new recon modules or AI models.
*   **Reporting:** Clear and actionable output.
*   **Configuration:** Flexible configuration for API keys, scan intensity, etc.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack (Tentative)

*   Python 3.x
*   Key Python Libraries: `requests`, `dnspython`, `python-nmap`, `beautifulsoup4`, `argparse`, (AI/ML: `scikit-learn`, `nltk`, `spacy`, `transformers` - choose as needed)
*   External Tools: (Wrappers for) Amass, Subfinder, Nmap, Nuclei (for known vuln checks), etc.
*   (Optional) Database: SQLite for local storage, or more robust options for larger datasets.

## üèÅ Getting Started

*(This section will be filled in as you build)*

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Smart-BugBounty-Recon.git
    cd Smart-BugBounty-Recon
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  Configure API keys (e.g., in `config.ini`):
    ```bash
    cp config.example.ini config.ini
    # Edit config.ini with your keys
    ```
4.  Run a basic scan:
    ```bash
    python smart_recon.py -d example.com
    ```
